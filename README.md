# OWOW Application â€“ Dimitri van Iersel

This repository was created specifically for my application to the Vibe Coder position at OWOW.

Most of my actual work lives in private prototypes, client environments, or is showcased on my portfolio: [https://looklistenlink.site](https://looklistenlink.site).

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to see live demos or code examples of my AI agents, frontend work, or UX projects.

Thanks for reading!
